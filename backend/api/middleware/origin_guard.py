"""AL\CE — Origin validation middleware for mutable endpoints.

Prevents cross-origin requests from untrusted web pages to sensitive
endpoints (e.g. PUT /config, PUT /settings). Since AL\CE runs locally,
this guards against malicious JS on arbitrary websites calling the
local API to disable security features.

Safe/read-only methods (GET, HEAD, OPTIONS) are always allowed.
WebSocket upgrades are excluded (handled by their own connection logic).
