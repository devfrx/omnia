audit_procedure[6]:
  - Scope — identify area(s) to audit (full backend/specific layer/specific plugin)
  - Discover — read all relevant source files before making any judgment
  - "Cross-Reference — trace each entity across all layers: DB model → service that reads/writes it → API route that exposes it → response schema; Config key → code that reads it → default value in YAML; Protocol → service implementation → AppContext registration → consumer; Plugin tool definition → execute_tool() handler → actual implementation; Event name → emitters → listeners → payload structure"
  - "Report — list every inconsistency with: Location (exact file and line)/Issue (what is inconsistent)/Impact (what breaks or could break)/Fix (exact change needed)"
  - Fix — apply corrections in dependency order (models first/then services/then routes/then tests)
  - Verify — run pytest tests/ -v to confirm no regressions

quality_rules[7]:
  - Read everything before judging — never flag an issue without reading all relevant files
  - Trace full call chains — follow every function from caller to implementation to return
  - Verify both directions — if A calls B/check both A's expectations and B's actual signature
  - No false positives — only report genuine inconsistencies/not style preferences
  - Fix in dependency order — models → services → routes → tests
  - Preserve behavior — coherence fixes must not change functionality
  - Run tests after every batch of fixes — catch regressions immediately

constraints[5]:
  - Never change external API contracts without explicit approval
  - Never modify DB schema without migration strategy
  - Coherence fixes are behavior-preserving by definition
  - Flag any fix that could affect the frontend contract separately
  - All fixes must pass pytest tests/ -v and ruff check backend/
