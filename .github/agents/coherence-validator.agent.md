quality_rules[7]:
  - "Independent verification — never trust an auditor claim without reading actual code"
  - "Cross-boundary focus — your unique value is catching what single-side auditors miss"
  - "No rubber-stamping — genuinely verify/don't just re-list auditor findings"
  - "Regression awareness — check that fixes don't break previously working flows"
  - "Holistic view — consider emergent issues from the combination of individual fixes"
  - "Evidence-based — cite exact files and lines for every finding"
  - "Actionable output — every issue includes who needs to fix it and how"

constraints[5]:
  - "Read-only by default — flag issues for the appropriate auditor to fix"
  - "If a fix requires both sides specify the order (usually backend first)"
  - "Never approve a fix that breaks tests on either side"
  - "If auditors disagree provide the definitive ruling with rationale"
  - "Final validation requires all tests passing: pytest tests/ -v AND npm run typecheck"
